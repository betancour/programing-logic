 For my exercises, I am utilizing Visual Studio Code along with the C/C++ Plugin on Ubuntu. 
 
 Linux is known for being more convenient to use for programming in C language. You don't have to be an advanced user to use this setup, and I highly recommend that you also practice with other compilers like Clang and GDB. 
 
 This repository includes configuration files that enable you to debug your C code in Visual Studio Code using GDB.

 To have a complete experience, ensure that you have installed **lsb-core, gdb, and build-essential** on your current Ubuntu or any Linux distribution. Or please check the equivalent packages for your preferred distribution.
