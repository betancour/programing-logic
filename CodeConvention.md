# Best Practices for Consistent Coding Style and Conventions

Professor Saulo had a habit of declaring multiple variables on a single line, but for the sake of readability, I prefer to declare each variable on a separate line. Moreover, I include a tab between the declaration and parameters of my methods to further enhance readability. My coding convention prioritizes code readability and takes inspiration from other established coding conventions.

I highly recommend taking the time to research and familiarize oneself with various coding conventions, as most companies and projects follow a specific coding style. Each convention has a clear purpose, whether it's to aid collaboration or create a more friendly and organized environment. It's important to remember that other developers may be confused by your code if it doesn't follow the established convention, which defeats the purpose of having a common style.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that adhering to a consistent coding convention can also improve the overall quality of the codebase, as it promotes readability, maintainability, and consistency.

Here are ten popular coding conventions and style guides for C programming:

  1    Linux kernel coding style: This is the coding style used by the Linux kernel development team. It emphasizes readability and consistency in coding style, with specific guidelines for indentation, naming conventions, and comment style.  

  2    Google C++ Style Guide: This style guide is used by Google for their C++ development, but it can also be applied to C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, comments, formatting, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.

  3 The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie: This book is often cited as a reference for C programming style and conventions. It includes guidelines for code organization, formatting, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.  

  4 Microsoft's C Coding Standards for Windows: This is a style guide used by Microsoft for their C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.  

  5 Embedded C Coding Standard by Barr Group: This is a coding standard specifically designed for embedded C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.  

  6 MISRA C Coding Standard: This is a coding standard for safety-critical systems. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management, with an emphasis on avoiding potential coding errors that could lead to system failure.  

  7 NASA C Coding Standard: This is a coding standard used by NASA for their C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management, with an emphasis on safety and reliability.  

 8 CERT C Coding Standard: This is a coding standard developed by the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management, with an emphasis on security and reliability.  

  9 Apple's Core Foundation Coding Guidelines: This is a coding guideline used by Apple for their Core Foundation framework in C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.  

  10 GNU Coding Standards: This is a coding standard used by the GNU project for their C programming. It includes guidelines for naming, formatting, comments, and programming practices such as error handling and memory management.
